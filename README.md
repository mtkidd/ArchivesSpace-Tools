# ArchivesSpace-Tools
This is a place for me to learn. I am new to coding and trying to learn new skills to help with my work in ArchivesSpace. 
My first attempt: Using the Schematron file referenced in ArchivesSpace@Yale blog post 
(https://campuspress.yale.edu/yalearchivesspace/2015/07/22/validation-scenarios/). I wanted to modify it to not include the id attributes for container grouping error message.
